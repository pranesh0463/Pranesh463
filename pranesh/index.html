              <strong>born 7 July 1981</strong> Born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand),
              India.

            <li>
              <strong> 2004</strong> Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong

            <li>
              <strong>T20 career </strong> On 12 February 2012,
               Dhoni made an unbeaten 44 to guide India to their first win over Australia at Adelaide.
                In the final over, he hit considerably large six which travelled 112 meters off the bowling of Clint McKay. 
                During the post-match presentation, he described this six as more important than the one he hit during the ICC World Cup final in 2011.

              He was named as captain and wicketkeeper of the 'Team of the Tournament' for the 2014 T20 World Cup by the ICC.[138]
            </li>
             <li>
              <strong>IPL career</strong> He  is a
              <i>captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) franchise in the Indian Premier League (IPL),
                 leading them to the final on 10 occasions and winning in the 2010, 2011, 2018, 2021 and 2023 editions of the league, as well as winning the Champions League T20 two times, in 2010 and 2014. 
                He is the 7th cricketer have scored more than 5,000 runs in the IPL, as well as being the first wicket-keeper
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Test career</strong>  Following his one-day performance against Sri Lanka, Dhoni replaced Dinesh Karthik in December 2005 as the Indian teams' Test wicket-keeper.Dhoni scored 30 runs in his debut match, that was marred by rain.
               Dhoni came to the crease when the team was at 109/5 and as wickets kept falling in quick succession,
                he played an aggressive innings in which he was the last man to be dismissed.
                 Dhoni made his maiden half-century in the second Test and his quick scoring rate (50 off 51 balls) helped India set a target of 436, where the Sri Lankans were then bowled out for 247.

              India toured Pakistan in January–February 2006 and Dhoni scored his maiden century in the second Test at Faisalabad. India was struggling, where Dhoni along with Irfan Pathan tried to recover, with the team still needing 107 runs to avoid a follow-on. Dhoni played in his naturally aggressive style as he brought up his maiden Test century in 93 balls, after scoring the first fifty in 34 deliveries
              
              Dhoni followed up the century with respectable batting performances over the next three matches, one against Pakistan that India lost and two against England that had India holding a 1–0 lead. Dhoni was the top scorer in India's first innings in the third Test at Wankhede Stadium as his 64 helped India post 279 in reply to England's 400. However, Dhoni and the Indian fielders dropped catches and missed many dismissal chances, including a key stumping opportunity of Andrew Flintoff .
               Dhoni failed to collect the Harbhajan Singh delivery cleanly as Flintoff went on to make 36 more runs as England set a target of 313 for the home team, a target that India was never in danger of threatening. A batting collapse saw the team being dismissed for 100 and Dhoni scored just 5 runs and faced criticism for his wicket-keeping lapses as well as his shot selection.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Retirement</strong> He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014 and
               stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On 15 August 2020, 
              Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket
